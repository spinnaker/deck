yarn stage
  Scaffolds a blank plugin into a temporary directory.
  Updates the scaffold's `dependencies` to match those currently in Deck.
  After running this, update the scaffolded `package.json` to the desired dependency versions.

yarn sync
  Syncs the desired dependency versions from the temporary directory to this `package.json`'s `peerDependencies`.
  This is useful to update peer devDependencies.

yarn clean
  Deletes the temp scaffold directory
