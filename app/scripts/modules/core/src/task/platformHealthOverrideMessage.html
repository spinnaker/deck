  Task not completing?

<p>
  By default, Spinnaker does not consider cloud provider health (i.e. whether your instances have launched and are running)
  as a reliable indicator of instance health.
</p>
<p>
  If your instances do not provide a health indicator known to Spinnaker
  (e.g. a discovery service or load balancers), you should configure your application to
  consider only cloud provider health when executing tasks. This option is available under Application Attributes
  in the <b>Config tab</b>.
