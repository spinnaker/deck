## Add a gif to show an action
GIFs are great to show an action, however they sometimes move too fast. 
One way to improve them is to capture 3 pieces of content:
- screenshot before an action
- screenshot after the action
- gif of the action
- You can edit a gif using https://ezgif.com/

## Put a border around a screenshot/gif
Add a border to help improve the readability.
